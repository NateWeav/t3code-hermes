/**
 * HindsightService — the environment's side of the Memory tab.
 *
 * Hindsight is an HTTP service on the same host, usually bound to loopback.
 * Every request a client makes goes through here, which is the whole point:
 * the panel works identically from a phone, a tunnel, or the desktop app, and
 * the API key never leaves this process.
 *
 * Request/response only. There is no poll, no subscription and no cache of
 * memories — the panel asks when the user asks, and Hindsight is a local
 * process answering in milliseconds. The one thing that is remembered is the
 * compatibility probe: `GET /version` is hit once and its verdict reused, so a
 * version mismatch is reported once at the top of the panel instead of turning
 * every keystroke into a failed round trip.
 *
 * Reads never fail. An unconfigured or unreachable Hindsight comes back as a
 * {@link HindsightStatus} on an empty result, because "not running" is
 * something the panel renders in words with a retry button, not an error toast
 * over a blank list. Writes do fail, with the same vocabulary as a reason —
 * the user pressed a button and is owed a straight answer.
 *
 * The connection is resolved per request: `integrations.hindsight` overrides
 * first, then the Hermes install's own Hindsight config (see
 * `hermesHindsightConfig.ts`), so editing either takes effect on the next read
 * without a restart. With the integration switched off, or nothing
 * configured anywhere, no socket is opened and the panel says why.
 *
