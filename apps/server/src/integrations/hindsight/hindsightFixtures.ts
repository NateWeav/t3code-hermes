/**
 * Hindsight response fixtures, transcribed from Hindsight's own schemas.
 *
 * Source: `vectorize-io/hindsight` at commit `205e47b4`, HTTP API 0.9.1 —
 * `hindsight-docs/static/openapi.json` for everything the spec types, and
 * `hindsight_api/engine/memories/pg/curation.py::list_memory_units` for the
 * memory-list rows, which the spec types only as bare objects.
 *
 * Every field Hindsight declares is present here, including the ones T3 Code
 * ignores. That is the point: a fixture trimmed to what the mappers read would
 * still pass after Hindsight renamed a field it does not use, and the drift
 * would surface as blank rows in someone's Memory tab instead.
