# Keep Hermes patches in place

A few T3 Code features need changes to Hermes itself that Hermes has not shipped yet. T3 Code
carries those changes as patches, and the Patches tab of the Hermes panel shows whether your Hermes
has each one. On web and desktop, the clock button in the sidebar footer opens the panel; Patches
is the third tab. On mobile, open **Settings → Hermes → Patches**.

Each patch shows one of three states:

- **Applied**: your Hermes has the change.
- **Not applied**: it fits your Hermes. **Apply** adds it.
- **Doesn't apply**: it doesn't fit your Hermes as it is. The tab says why:
  - **Hermes is older than this patch**: update Hermes, then it applies.
  - **Waiting for a T3 Code update**: Hermes has moved past the patch. A later T3 Code release
    brings a version that fits.
  - **Local changes in the files this patch touches**: you have uncommitted edits where the patch
    goes. Commit or discard them in the Hermes checkout first.

**Remove** takes an applied patch back out. Applying or removing affects new Hermes sessions; a
chat that is already running keeps the Hermes it started with.

The Hermes gateway, which serves messaging platforms, scheduled tasks, and webhooks, keeps running
the code it started with. When it started before your latest patch change, the tab says so and
offers **Restart gateway**. Apply or remove everything you want first, then restart once: the
gateway finishes the chats, tasks, and webhook runs it is working on before it restarts. A gateway
started with `hermes gateway run` in a terminal does not run as a service, so restart it there.

## Update Hermes

When a patch is waiting on a newer Hermes, the tab offers **Update Hermes**. It removes T3 Code's
applied patches, updates Hermes, then puts back each one using the version that fits the new
Hermes. Afterwards the tab says what was reapplied and what is now waiting for a T3 Code update. If
the update fails, the patches you had are put back.

It refuses to run while the checkout has uncommitted edits of your own, because updating would park
them in a git stash where they are easy to lose track of. Commit or discard them first. It leaves a
running Hermes gateway alone, so it never restarts without its patches; restart it afterwards with
**Restart gateway**, as after any patch change. Hermes from before September 2026 always restarts
its gateway while updating, before the patches are back, so restart it once more afterwards.

## Things to know

- Patches need Hermes installed from a git checkout, the same kind of install that can update
  itself. Package-manager and container installs show why the tab has nothing to do.
- Updating Hermes yourself keeps applied patches. If an update leaves a patch no longer fitting,
  the tab shows it as **Doesn't apply** rather than failing the update.
- If the tab warns about a detached HEAD, your Hermes checkout is pinned to one commit and updates
  cannot move it. Run `git checkout main` in the checkout, then update Hermes.
